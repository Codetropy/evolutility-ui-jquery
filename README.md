# evol-utility

evol-utility is a generic web UI for Backbone.js. 

It will provide the following web forms (or Backbone.js Views).

    * View
    * Edit
    * List
    * Search
    * Export
    * Charts
    * Dashboards
    * Mass Update
    * Login

Currently under development, only [Search](https://github.com/evoluteur/advancedSearch) is checked-in.


## The Plan 

    1- Define Meta-model and APIs
    2- Build all UI forms
    3- Add a toolbar and a controller for all these forms

evol-utility is a natural evolution of [Evolutility](http://www.evolutility.org). 

## UI Model 

A UI model is a description of what the attributes of your Backbone.js model look like and how they behave on the web.

Many different views can be generated based on the same UI model (combined with a Backbone model). This UI model will be some kind of [Minimalist Meta-Model for CRUD Applications](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/28636/Minimalist-Meta-Model-for-CRUD-Applications).
