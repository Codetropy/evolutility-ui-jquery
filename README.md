# evol-utility

evol-utility is an evolving UI for your data.  

It provides forms for:

    * View
    * Edit
    * List
    * Search
    * Export
    * Charts
    * Dashboards
    * Mass Update
    * Login

Currently under development, only [Search](https://github.com/evoluteur/advancedSearch) is checked-in.


## The Plan 

    1- Build all UI forms widgets
    2- Add a toolbar and a controller for all these forms
    3- Define Meta-model and APIs

Later will come

    4- Build the server part (REST implemented on different stacks)
    5- Build a centralized app dictionary (and have apps to build and modify other apps)
    6- Build a mobile version
    7- Build a community to share apps

evol-utility is a natural evolution of [Evolutility](http://www.evolutility.org). 

## Model 
All views will use the same meta-model, some kind of [Minimalist Meta-Model for CRUD Applications](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/28636/Minimalist-Meta-Model-for-CRUD-Applications).
